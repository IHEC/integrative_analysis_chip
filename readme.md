This is the IHEC wrapper around the ENCODE ChIP-Seq pipeline that captures that IHEC specific configurations for analyzing ChIP-Seq data through the ENCODE pipeline.  

For an introduction to the ENCODE ChIP-Seq pipeline see: (ENCODE-DCC/chip-seq-pipeline2)[https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/chip-seq-pipeline2]

Please see the documentation available [here](encode-wrapper/readme.md) to set up and test the pipeline.
